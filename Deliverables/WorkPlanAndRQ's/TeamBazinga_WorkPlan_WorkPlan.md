# Nebraska Education Profile

## **Description**

>This Data set contains a multitude of information. There are 10 files in total, I am not sure if all of them are needed for analysis, but it depends on what questions someone would ask. Contained inside is information regarding Nebraska schools from the 2015-2016 year. There is information regarding Attendance Rate, Dropout Rates, Teacher information (general info, not specific personal info), and test scores around Math, Reading, Science, Writing. This information could be used to evaluate the success of Nebraska Schools, and determine which schools are more successful than others.

## **About the Data**

>There are nine files you are able to download. These are all text files, and I took all nine of them and uploaded them into two Excel documents. The total size of the two files is 43 MB. Each tab contains a different file. In looking at the information it appears the data goes back to 2011. This would be enough to make some kind of time series analysis. For all nine tables there are a combined total of 120 columns, not all are unique. Some of the columns are repeated in each table. for instance the four Exam tables all have the same 15 columns of information. The number of unique columns is 41. If you add up all the records between those files you will get 802,193 records. There seams to be a healthy mix of Qualitative and Quantitative data. Qualitative would be things like "School Year", "School", "District", "Type", "Description". Quantitative would be things like "Graduation Count","Dropout Rate", "Teacher Experience", "Count of Masters degree teachers".

## **Licensing Information**

>The Terms and Conditions page seems to be inactive on the main page, so no specific information regarding data usage could be found. I also checked the Privacy policy at "http://nep.education.ne.gov/privacy-policy/" and it gives a 404 error. There was nothing else I could find that would give me specific information in this general area. However, The Nebraska Department of Education is responsible for this data, which is a branch of the Nebraska Government, so I decided to go to the Nebraska.gov/policies page and found the following.

## **Potential Users**

Any parent who wants to make sure their children are provided the best education possible. This could have an impact on where people decide to live so they can get into the best school district. This information could become useful to the Nebraska Government in trying to figure out the education profile of the citizens of Nebraska.
